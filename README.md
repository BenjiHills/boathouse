# The Boathouse Reasturant Website
Restaurant Website. Currently allows customers to order a takeaway from a set menu and view their previous order. Staff are able to set the menu and also view orders.End goal is to bulid a full functioning website with both a front end and back end created by me, including additional feature such as; a table booking system and the ability  for staff to assign bills to a table.
